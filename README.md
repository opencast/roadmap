# Roadmap initiative

IMPORTANT: All you can read below is work in progress.

## Purpose

The roadmap initiative (with its meeting, repository and project) is an initiative to improve transparency, coordination, and collaboration among all stakeholders of the Opencast community. All parts and projects related to Opencast are welcome to participate, regardless of their topic and their size.

## General informations
While the benefits are clear, achieving them requires a structured processes and active participation of stakeholders. Therefore, please read the following informations carefully. The main component of this initiative are the roadmap meetings (four times a year) and the issues created in this repository (using the templates «Idea» and «Project»), which get organised using the Github project «Opencast Roadmap».
The roadmap initiative follows a bottom-up approach, meaning it is open to everyone and relies on the active contributions of stakeholders to function effectively. Therefore, all parts of this initiative (meeting, github repository and project) are not ment to be for an exclusive group but rather an integrated effort within the broader community, ensuring collective ownership and shared responsibility.  Both large-scale projects and small ideas can contribute meaningfully to the community.

## Roadmap meeting
The roadmap meeting will take place four times a year (specific dates see below). In this meeting, we will discuss new ideas to improve Opencast and new as well as ongoing projects. To schedule an idea or project do be discussed in the next roadmap meeting, there needs to be an issue created in the "roadmap" repository (please follow specific rules below). All scheduled ideas and projects will be presented by the project/idea owner and discussed with all participants present.

- **Regular Meetings:** The reuglar meetings take place three times a year. The agenda will be:

  2. New ideas (5 min presentation + 5 min discussion)
  3. New projects (10 min presentation + 5 min discussion)
     
- **Annual Review (in November):** The goal of the annual review meeting is to reflect on the projects and ideas of the past year and plan the upcoming year. In preparation to the meeting, the facilitators will close all issues 3 weeks before the meeting. If ideas or projects are still relevant, the owner(s) can reopen the corresponding issues.

### Documentation
If you want to present and/or discuss your idea or project on a roadmap meeting, you first need to open an issue in the Github repository "roadmap". Use one of the corresponding issue templates (there is one for ideas and one for projects). Please give all informations that are requested by the templates. During the meetings, the facilitator (or a person assigned by the facilitator) notes the decisions and next steps in a comment to this issue.

### Maintenance & Triage
- 
- Inactive issues will automatically get closed after six months of inactivity and moved to the coloumn "Abandoned". The assigned owner can reopen the issue and place it in the suitable coloumn.
- Companies and developers are kindly asked to comment on a ticket and provide recommendations from a technical point of you.
- A group of stakeholders (including developers) will regularly discuss new issues and projects. If you want to join this group, please contact the current facilitator (see above).
