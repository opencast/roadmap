# Roadmap initiative

**This is work in progress!**

## Purpose
The roadmap initiative (with its meeting, repository and project) is to improve transparency, coordination, and collaboration among all stakeholders of the Opencast community. All parts and projects related to Opencast are welcome to participate, regardless of their topic and their size - visibility is key!

## General information
The main component of this initiative are 
- the roadmap meetings (four times a year) and
- the issues created in this repository (using the templates «Idea» and «Project»), which is based on the Github project «Opencast Roadmap».

## Roadmap meeting
The roadmap meeting will take place four times a year (specific dates see below). In this meeting, we will discuss new ideas to improve Opencast and new as well as ongoing projects. To schedule an idea or project do be discussed in the next roadmap meeting, there needs to be an issue created in the "roadmap" repository (please follow specific rules below). All scheduled ideas and projects will be presented by the project/idea owner and discussed with all participants present.

### Documentation / Github
If you want to present and/or discuss your idea or project in a roadmap meeting, you need to shortly open an issue in the Github repository "roadmap". Use one of the corresponding issue templates:
- **ideas** is for smaller initiatives, one-person initiatives or short-term cooperation;
- **projects** is for (institutional) cooperations, mid- to long-term with different stakeholders.
Please provide  all informations requested by the templates.

During/after meetings, the facilitator (or a person assigned by the facilitator) notes the decisions and next steps in a comment to this issue.

### Maintenance & Triage
- Inactive issues will automatically get closed after six months of inactivity and moved to the coloumn "Abandoned". The assigned owner can reopen the issue and place it in the suitable coloumn.
- Companies and developers are kindly asked to comment on a ticket and provide recommendations from a technical point of you.
- A group of stakeholders (including developers) will regularly discuss new issues and projects. If you want to join this group, please contact the facilitator(s) organising the meeting.
