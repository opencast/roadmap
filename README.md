# Roadmap initiative

IMPORTANT: All you can read below is work in progress.

## Purpose & general informations

The roadmap initiative (with its meeting, repository and project) is an initiative to improve transparency, coordination, and collaboration among all stakeholders of the Opencast community. 

## General informations
While the benefits are clear, achieving them requires active participation of stakeholders and structured processes. Therefore, please read the following informations carefully. The roadmap initiative follows a bottom-up approach, meaning it is open to everyone and relies on the active contributions of stakeholders to function effectively. Therefore, all parts of this initiative (meeting, github repository and project) are not ment to be for an exclusive group but rather an integrated effort within the broader community, ensuring collective ownership and shared responsibility. All projects related to Opencast are welcome to participate, regardless of their topic and their size. Both large-scale projects and small ideas can contribute meaningfully to the community.
