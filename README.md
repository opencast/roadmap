# Roadmap initiative

**2025: This is work in progress**

## Purpose
The roadmap initiative (with its meeting, repository and project) is to improve transparency, coordination, and collaboration among all stakeholders of the Opencast community. All parts and projects related to Opencast are welcome to participate, regardless of their topic and their size - visibility is key!

## General information
The main component of this initiative are 
- the roadmap meetings,
- the issues created in this repository (using the templates «Idea» and «Project») and
- the Github project «Opencast Roadmap» (to organise the issues and meetings).

## Roadmap meeting
The roadmap meeting will take place four times a year (specific dates see below). In this meeting, we will discuss new ideas to improve Opencast and new as well as ongoing projects. Ideas and projects will be presented by the project/idea owner and discussed with all participants present.

### Creating an issue Schedule a presentation/discussion
If you want to present and/or discuss your idea or project in a roadmap meeting, you need to have an issue in the Github repository "roadmap". To create a new issue, use one of the corresponding issue templates and provide all required information:
- **ideas**: for smaller initiatives, one-person initiatives or short-term cooperation;
- **projects**: for (institutional) cooperations, mid- to long-term with different stakeholders.

### Schedule a presentation/discussion
In the meeting, all issues from the columns "New" and "Presentation" will be discussed. If you create a new issue, it will automatically show up in the column "New". If you are owner of an ongoing project and you want to discuss your project in the next meeting, move it to the column "Presentation".

During/after meetings, the facilitator (or a person assigned by the facilitator) notes the decisions and next steps in a comment to this issue.

### Maintenance & Triage
- Inactive issues will automatically get closed after six months of inactivity and moved to the coloumn "Abandoned". The assigned owner can reopen the issue and place it in the suitable coloumn.
- Companies and developers are kindly asked to comment on a ticket and provide recommendations from a technical point of you.
- A group of stakeholders (including developers) will regularly discuss new issues and projects. If you want to join this group, please contact the facilitator(s) organising the meeting.

### Types of meetings 
- **Regular Meetings:** The reuglar meetings take place three times a year. The agenda will be:
  1. Status report on running projects (5 min presentation + 5 min discussion)
  2. New ideas (5 min presentation + 5 min discussion)
  3. New projects (10 min presentation + 5 min discussion)
     
- **Annual Review (in November):** The goal of the annual review meeting is to reflect on the projects and ideas of the past year and plan the upcoming year. In preparation to the meeting, the facilitators will close all issues 3 weeks before the meeting. If ideas or projects are still relevant, the owner(s) can reopen the corresponding issues.
