# Roadmap meeting

IMPORTANT: All you can read below is work in progress.

## Purpose

The roadmap meeting (with its repository and project) is an initiative to improve transparency, coordination, and collaboration among all stakeholders of the Opencast community. While the benefits are clear, achieving them requires active participation and structured processes. This initiative follows a bottom-up approach, meaning it is open to everyone and relies on the active contributions of stakeholders to function effectively. The meeting is not ment to be for an exclusive group but rather an integrated effort within the broader community, ensuring collective ownership and shared responsibility. All projects related to Opencast are welcome to participate, regardless of their topic their size. Both large-scale projects and small ideas can contribute meaningfully to the community.
